      "A few days later I found myself at the court of the Fairy Queen, who, thanks to the genius that was within her, had been enchanted with the beauty of the son she had lost.\n",
      "When, after twelve long years, the fairy discovered that the son she had loved was of such poor health that she could not pay the father the three florins she had promised, she laughed at him and referred XXXXX him to the courts of justice .\tto\t\tIn|Since|OF|as|at|because|by|if|in|that\n",

      "The king of the country asked for the same; and in vain did the young man send for the fairy to summon her attendant spirits.\n",
      "At last the fairy gave him a beautiful crystal doll, who, when she had played with him in the pool, had become transformed into the ebony monkey commonly seen in royal chapels.\n",
      "The enchanted youth played his parts as well as ever, and became in the act of carrying the doll to the play-ground.\n",
      "When he had finished it the fairy said : ` Now, the king is in your hands, and must give honourable consideration to your services.\n",
      "But what is a better proof of the success of love than that you should yield to the wishes of the stranger ?'\n",
      "The trumpeter hailed the fairies joyfully, and proclaimed that they deserved the crown ; but on his departure the fairy told him that if he did not return within two weeks she would Beatrix van Beeste, who was in mortal danger of losing her life.\n",
      "This threat was too much for poor Milo, and he grieved for its consequences in a way which the poor princess did not feel at all : he submitted to be married, but only on the condition that he should have one thing in particular reserved for his bride-mother.\n",
      "It was said that she would have a son by her -- a ho!\n",
      "-- and the son was said to be quite a virgin.\n",

      "Then the hares were tied round the roan mare, and Darby tied the tail tight so as to choke it, and told it to the two robbers.\n",
      "In the meantime the cock had flown to the king, who was kneeling by the gate, and said : ` Send at once and tell the queen that her son is dead, and hath flown away.\n",
      "If she does not appear in the evening, I will call on the gardener and the banker .'\n",
      "The robbers were taken in by the robbers, and brought their families with them.\n",
      "The poor old mother did not know what to do, and in despair sat down on the steps and cry bitterly.\n",

      "You have only yourself to blame for your whole race being ruined, and I am only a wanderer who has lost my way.\n",
      "But if you will grant me a single request, you will restore my child to me, and in that case we will both be saved .'\n",
      "Then the king and the queen wept, but they saw there was no escape.\n",
      "So they sent for the two Wise Men, and they answered : ` We are the sons of the Almighty God, who has formed\n",

      "The next morning the prince set his foot on board a ship, and was soon as good as well sailing on the water ; but he never thought of land till his return, when, taking advantage of his journey in the meantime, he happened to pick up the golden ball, and bring it back to the country of the great king his father.\n",
      "But he found that he was a long way off, and had a great time to get his wife and a good wife for all, so as to prevent her being separated from him ; and she told him of her sorrow and longing.\n",
      "` I shall have to bear the burden!\n",
      "I shall be a poor lad at home .'\n",
      "And her father told her how he had loved and loved her as well as a lion ; and she said, ` We must work together as men, and each of us will bring in his own way .'\n",
      "So they worked together, and when the king asked the eldest of his three subjects what the princess meant, he said, ` If all goes well, I will bring you back with me .'\n",
      "So the other two went to lay the golden ball, and when he had brought it he made it dance up to his father, and said, ` You are the fairest and most beautiful princess ; so you shall come back with me to the castle .'\n",
      "But when the elder son had thrown some stones into the water and turned the ball over in his hands, he was driven off with a great shriek, and the youngest son was only frightened .'\n",
      "I had always loved you, ' said he, ` but you are dead in all the world .'\n",
      "But the king was so terrified and much vexed before him that all were afraid to see it, and he could do nothing for fear of their looking for his daughter.\n",
      "When the princess was far off, she sat down upon a stone, and said to herself what would be the end of it all for her if the ball was not returned at once.\n",
      "And so she went back to her own family, and asked her mother , ` Come into the palace in safety, with this ball, ' and she waited for the arrival of her father.\n",
      "And when that was announced the king 's son threw down the basket as fast as he could, and put it behind him.\n",
      "So the younger princess came out of the boat, and told him what had been done when he had come back from the country of the Great King his father.\n",
      "` But this is as a long time as mine, ' replied the princess .'\n",
      "I was going by your daughter, the Queen of the Seas ; but you and her mother were driving with the money and jewels of the kingdom, so that each could leave nothing behind for you.\n",
      "Your daughter is not the least of these ; let me go now and bring her a gift .'\n",
      "The princess threw down her basket, and began to tear her hair, as she had a good hair.\n",
      "But with all her pains a brave maiden would have her hair trimmed in this fashion, and she had heard of many men who fell in love with beautiful and beautiful maidens, when they have been so badly treated.\n",
      "` Give me back my golden ball !'\n",
      "and she called out, ` It will be a beautiful prize to you and me !'\n",

      "` You will have to do all that the Maid of the Sea has done, or I will give it back to you .'\n",
      "But the princess held out her hand, and asked, ` Let me get back gold and silver !'\n",
      "then they threw it into the sea.\n",
      "` You have no need of that ; take leave of me, ' said the king ; ` but if you have come too far I can not take you back with me .'\n",
      "` Yes, my father will give you back my golden ball .'\n",
      "And the princess had to wait till the next day, that would have been the best time, but the royal son had got all his money and jewels and was beginning to set forth his journey ; so she gave in her money, and the journey was very long at least, because the journey-money was very large.\n",
      "At last they came, and the king returned as before, and was received with the golden ball, which was made in the palace of the great King his father, with two white gold and three red gold in it.\n",
      "And when he had laid it among the three maidens he was turned away from there, and was driven off back again to land.\n",
